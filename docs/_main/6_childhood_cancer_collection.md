# Childhood Cancer Collection

Childhood Cancer Collections (CCC) is a curated collection of pediatric cancer research-relevant datasets available from refine.bio.
Childhood Cancer Data Data Lab staff members select the experiments in CCC based on criteria such as the information contained in submitter-supplied abstracts, age ranges associated with samples, and tagged ontology terms.
The CCC offers improved searching and filtering functionality to make it easier for pediatric cancer researchers to discover and use data from refine.bio, as detailed below.
