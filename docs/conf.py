# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# followed by a colon. For example, index:Introduction for a section called
# Introduction that appears in document index.rst. Useful for avoiding
# ambiguity when the same section heading appears in different documents.
